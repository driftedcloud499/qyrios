🌌 Qyrios

Qyrios is a quantum-augmented cognition engine that fuses simulation intelligence, generative reasoning, and probabilistic computation.
It builds living digital twins of systems — from ecosystems to economies — that evolve, predict, and adapt in real time.

⚡ Overview

Qyrios isn’t a simulator.
It’s a reality synthesizer — a framework where virtual systems learn, mutate, and self-optimize through hybrid quantum–classical logic.

Each Qyrios Node runs a Quantum Cognition Core (QCC) that merges causal modeling, uncertainty quantization, and emergent strategy formation.

✨ Core Features

🌀 Quantum Reasoning Fabric — blends classical inference with quantum amplitude encoding for superposed decision exploration

🌍 Living Digital Twins — continuously evolving models that learn from live sensor or market data

🧭 Adaptive Scenario Engine — self-updates world models based on shifting goals and entropy thresholds

🔗 Entangled Collaboration — quantum-linked nodes share probabilistic state vectors for cooperative reasoning

🧠 Recursive Meta-Simulation — simulations within simulations to test futures across time horizons

🧩 Cognitive Thermodynamics — energy-aware resource allocation for sustainable AI workloads

🔒 Ethical Superposition Core — constrains outcome probabilities within aligned moral bounds

📦 Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qyrios.git
cd qyrios
pip install -r requirements.txt


Requirements:
Python 3.11+, CUDA / ROCm GPU, Qiskit or Braket SDK (optional quantum backend)

🚀 Quick Start
from qyrios import Node, QuantumNet

# Create quantum cognition node
core = Node("Nova", domain="climate systems")

# Connect to entangled network
qnet = QuantumNet()
qnet.link(core)

# Launch self-adaptive simulation
core.simulate()
core.evolve()


Console Output:

[Qyrios] Node 'Nova' initialized with domain vector (climate, sustainability)
[Qyrios] Entangling with 24 peers via QuantumNet...
[Qyrios] Scenario decomposition complete → 512 quantum threads
[Qyrios] Evolution cycle #3 → stability 0.981 (entropy balanced)
